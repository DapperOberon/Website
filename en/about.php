        <p>Hi, I'm Cameron Smith a student studying Front-End Web Development (FEWD) and Game Design. I love designing websites and games as well as taking photos and playing piano.</p>

        <p>I'm based in Oregon, USA and currently working on my Information Technology degree at Liberty University Online. I have been studing web design in my free time for the past eight years and game design for the past two years. I orignially planned to study graphic design but found web design and game design more interesting and have been hooked ever since.</p>

        <p>The site is currently under construction, so please be patient.</p>
